Returning from Jackson Hole. The west is beautiful.

History 102

    Spengler cycles of history - Civilizations rise, become decadent, collapse, conquered by outsiders, cycle repeats.

    Whig history - History is teleological - concept of progress.

    Civil War - Northern industry was dominant, Lincoln's assassination hurt reconstruction. Slavery wasn't really profitable until the cotton gin was invented (1790), would have been easier to abolish slavery otherwise.

    Christianity - One god, everything is love - against dominant state religions at the time of Roman empire

    Civilizational Differences - Linear time is unique to the West and only came about recently. Ancient Africa didn't treat time as real. Others propose time is cyclical.

    Mesopotamia - Nile river is regular, Tigris and Euphrates less predictable, reflected in gods of different cultures - Egyptian gods are nurturing, mesopotamia is battle of order and chaos.
