# Da Ultimate Rap Battle - 564 Dope-Ass Rap Songs, Ranked

I wanted to figure out what my favorite rap song was but couldn't quite decide, so went way overboard and built an elaborate tournament structure inspired by the World Cup and pitted all 564 rap songs saved to my Spotify liked songs to even attempt to answer the question.

The methodology did not disappoint. Multiple group rounds whittled down the huge pool of tracks without too many agonizing early exits, allowing the cream to really rise to the top. Turns out it's pretty straightforward to just rank four songs, and that scales quite nicely. The knockout round eliminations were mostly tracks I wouldn't write home about, squad round performance generally seems just in hindsight, and the bracket round of 128 contained exclusively fire tracks that I can listen to always.

The drama of single-elimination in the bracket round meant a ton of the battles were extremely close, which meant I had to let go of overthinking and simply make the call. No doubt a different lunch, a change in the weather, or a millisecond difference causing the input to my laptops `shuf` program to randomize the track ordering in a different way might have meant "I Can" or "Colt 45" or "New York" ended up in the quarterfinals instead of gettin' left at some earlier stage.

There are tons of rap songs and rappers that other people like that aren't on here. What can I say? I have better taste than you.




## Rounds

### Prep

1. Spotify liked songs > filter on hip hop > create playlist
2. Scan existing for artists to review further > fill in anything missing
3. Remove freestyles, remixes, rnb, duplicates, etc.
4. End up with 564 tracks to pit against each other!


### Knockout Round

564 tracks whittled down to a clean 512. Randomly-selected tracks subjected to a group round before the group round.

### Squad Round

All 512 tracks are sorted into 32 different squads of 16 tracks each.

Each squad battles it out for 4 seeds in the final bracket round.

Group Round 1 - Groups of 4 tracks each, ranked 1-4. Top two from each group advance. Half the tracks are eliminated here.

Group Round 2 - Winners are shuffled into two new groups and compete again. Top two from each make it through for a total of 4 top tracks in the squad.

Top four tracks from 32 squads are ranked 1-4 based on performance and my good judgement in the case of a tie-breaker.

128 tracks remain after the Squad Round and they're all top-notch.


### Bracket Round

Tracks are seeded evenly throughout the bracket to prevent competing again until the semifinals. Better performance in group and squad rounds leads to a more favorable matchup similar to march madness or world cup seeding (ie, #1 vs #4, #2 vs #3).

128 tracks, head-to-head, then 64, then 32, then 16, then 8, then 4, then 2, then ...

Ice Cube's _Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It_ beats out Jadakiss and Nas's _What If_ for my favorite rap song of all time. A pyroclastic flow indeed, congratulations to the grand wizard, warlord, vocal chords so vicious, the one and only Ice Cube for a really sick rap song that's a radical political anthem about the genre's celebration of gratuitous violence, lawlessness, and machisimo making gangsta rap a lightning rod of controversy and an easy scapegoat for the ills of the culture that these artists are first and foremost _reflecting_ from their world.

Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it.
