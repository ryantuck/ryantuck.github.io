# The Ultimate Rap Battle - 564 Dope-Ass Rap Songs, Ranked

## Rounds

### Round 0 - Qualifying

564 tracks whittled down to a clean 512. Randomly-selected tracks subjected to a group round before the group round.

### Round 1 - Group Round

Groups of 4 tracks each, ranked 1-4. Top two from each group advance.

256 tracks remain.

### Round 2 - Squad Round

Every four groups comprise a squad.

Winners from four groups are shuffled into two new groups and ranked 1-4 again. Top two from each group advance again.

128 tracks remain and they're all top-notch.

### Round 3 - Squads Ranked

Top four tracks from 32 squads are ranked 1-4 based on performance after two group rounds and my good judgement in the case of a tie-breaker.


### Round 4 - Seeding

Tracks are seeded evenly throughout the bracket to prevent competing again until the semifinals. Better performance in group and squad rounds leads to a more favorable matchup similar to march madness or world cup seeding.

### Round 5 - Tournament!

128 tracks, head-to-head, then 64, then 32, then 16, then 8, then 4, then 2, then ...

Ice Cube's Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It beats out Jadakiss and Nas's What If for my favorite rap song of all time.
