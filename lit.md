# LIT

## Rave Gear, Revolutionized

**Light Integrated Threads** was a startup started just out of college by Danny Kern and Ryan Tuck to make the world's most sophisticated wearable technology for the EDM community.

Our flagship product, the LIT Halo, was 32 audio-responsive full-color LEDs in the form of a lightweight headband.

Our journey lasted from 2012 to 2014, culminating in a failed Kickstarter campaign to fund our first formal manufacturing round. We aimed for $60k, and ended up raising over $16k from over 180 people.

Since then, we've both gone on to successful technical careers. It was the coolest work I've ever done.
