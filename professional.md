# Professional

Previous blockchain experience?

None professional, long-held casual interest. Hold some crypto currently, read the Satoshi whitepaper in 2015, tried setting up an Ethereum mining node on my Macbook Air in 2018, and believe there's long-term political value to blockchain applications as a tool to support individual freedom and resist tyranny.

What excites you about the role?

The value of the "verifiable web" seems like it will only increase with the advent of smarter and smarter AI systems that we are still hopelessly inept at being able to reliably control and align. I'm in for the mission, see blockchain experience section. Godspeed to you all regardless!

Etc

Hi, I believe my experience maintaining production LLM usage at my most recent role might come in handy should Spring Health want to employ me! I've got 10+ years experience in backend and data engineering domains, senior IC, tech lead, management positions. Improving access to any kind of health care does seem like a technical problem to solve rather than a fact of life, and I'm glad y'all are working on it. I'm available for a brief intro call to figure out if we would like to collaborate on a full-time or contract basis. Let me know and best of luck regardless, thanks!

Experience with stack?

Linux - expert, no stranger to shelling onto boxes in prod to patch things, experienced enough to know better than to have to do that often!

PostgreSQL - many battle scars from pg_stat_activity, I've worked with Postgres, mixed feelings about ORMs vs raw SQL, one of the earliest adopters (~2019) of dbt for Postgres

Vue.js - none, but I'm certain r1 or o3 can help me pick it up quick!

Go - none. At my last role my go-to for rapidly picking up Ruby and TypeScript was asking Claude "how do I do PYTHON THING in Ruby?" or "generate a typescript API call that POSTs to URL with with an empty payload" and then iterating on the result. It worked really well, and I'm excited about other languages!

Database experience?


Expert - PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Redshift

Mid - Snowflake, MySQL (similar-enough to postgres, but subtle quirks at deeper layers)

The above are formal database systems, though there are many data structures in the world that function as databases. Filesystems are kind of databases, as are spreadsheets, warehouses, closets, drawers, and desks.
