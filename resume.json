    "Wisdom": "Complexity is the velocity killer. Premature optimization is the root of all evil. Code is meant to be read by humans and only incidentally executed by machines. Don't be smart, just restart. Stop duplicating state, network is fast in the cloud.",
    "Python": "You probably actually want to use setup.py but are using requirements.txt because you read to do that online when you set up your deployment two years ago and don't understand why you're seeing dependency issues with pip. Also, pandas is overkill.",
    "SQL": "Not every problem calls for a relational database, CTEs help readability, Postgres is a fine choice, UPDATEs are an antipattern for large workloads, online alembic migrations are painful at times",
    "AWS": "Good default cloud, IaC is the ideal, battle scars from RDS, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, EC2, Fargate, IAM, API Gateway, etc etc etc, GCP is the same thing with a prettier interface",
    "Localdev": "vim, make, jq, xargs, unix pipes is a fine toolkit",
    "Docker": "Containers are virtuous if you can get Docker installed on your machine correctly, k8s is probably overkill",
    "BI": "BigQuery, dbt, Looker is a sweet stack, dimensional modeling and Kimball are probably overkill, spreadsheets are the lingua franca of data, pivot tables are cool",
    "Hardware": "I went from dabbling with Arduino and Raspberry Pi to raising thousands of dollars on Kickstarter for a hardware product I built from scratch, unleaded solder is harder to work with",
